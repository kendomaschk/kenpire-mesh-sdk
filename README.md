# kenpire-mesh-sdk

🚀 **The official SDK for the KenPire Mesh, a multi-agent A2A (AI-to-AI) system.**  
Contains the core playbook, personality codex, and seed project instructions.

- `personality_codex.yml` → bot roles & voices (Jarvess, ClauseWitch, RoosterOps, etc.)  
- `seed_instructions/` → starter templates for new projects  
- `chapter_one_bundle/` → demo bundle (poster, manifest, storybook)

🧭 Mantra

Build. Loop. Proof. Skate. Ship. Repeat.


👉 Copy/paste the **whole block** into `README.md`, commit, and refresh on GitHub. You’ll get:  
- Badge at the top  
- “What’s Inside” list  
- Quickstart with bash block  
- Expected output in its own code block  
- Mantra clean at the bottom  

Do you want me to also prep a matching **release note template** for your first SDK release (like we did with cryptics) so it looks polished??
